Introduction

implementing an issue tracking system using mern stack with provisions for
handling issues, i.e. creation, deletion, discussion, updating priority, etc.,\
handling member permissions, basic sign up, log out features, etc.

--------------------

Proposed Method

Started by implementing a signup and login system in mern. Used bcryptjs to hash the passwords.

On login it displays the issues page.

The issue page has the list of all currently accessible issues with links to them \
as well as options to delete an issue and add new issues.\
logout button implemented in navbar

the new issue pages takes all required parameters like subject description, priority, status, team responsible, etc

on clicking an issue, takes you to a dynamically generated page containing details about the issue as well as\
ability to view discussion, add comment and delete comments

-----------------------

Work Done

Completed login and signup
Issues homepage with links to issue and create new issue completely implemented.
provisional delete issue button provided
New issue page created without styling or backend connection
issue page loads details as well as discussion and allows basic commenting and deletion with database support

---------------------

Conclusion

fairly complete implementation of a bug tracking system in mern stack
